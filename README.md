🫀 HeartCare Monitoring System

An Adaptive, Privacy-Preserving Heart Disease Prediction Framework

📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection and continuous monitoring can significantly reduce risks, but traditional machine learning systems rely on centralized data collection, raising serious privacy and security concerns.

The HeartCare Monitoring System is an intelligent healthcare analytics framework designed to provide secure, adaptive, and reliable heart disease prediction. The system integrates privacy-preserving learning, adaptive model selection, concept drift handling, and real-time monitoring through an interactive dashboard.

Unlike conventional systems, HeartCare dynamically adapts to changes in a patient’s physiological or lifestyle patterns and ensures prediction reliability using a trust-aware decision mechanism.
